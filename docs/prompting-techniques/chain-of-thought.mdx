Chain-of-thought prompting asks the model to explain its reasoning step by step before giving an answer.

**Use when:**
- The task requires logical reasoning or multi-step thinking
- You want to see the model’s thought process

**Pattern:**
Ask the model to “think step by step” or “explain your reasoning.”

**Examples:**
```text
If there are 3 apples and you take away 2, how many are left? Explain your reasoning.
```
```text
A train leaves the station at 3 PM and travels at 60 km/h. Another train leaves at 4 PM at 80 km/h. When will the second train catch up? Show your calculations step by step.
```

**Pitfalls:**
- May generate unnecessary details for simple tasks
- Can increase response length
