---

Tree of Thoughts prompting explores several possible reasoning paths in parallel, allowing the model to consider and compare different solutions.

**Use when:**
- The task is open-ended or benefits from exploring alternatives
- You want to improve solution quality by comparing options

**Pattern:**
1. Ask the model to generate multiple possible solutions or reasoning paths.
2. Evaluate or compare the options to select the best one.

**Examples:**
```text
List three different ways to solve this puzzle, then choose the best approach and explain why.
```
```text
Propose several strategies for increasing user engagement on a website. Compare their pros and cons and recommend one.
```

**Pitfalls:**
- Can increase response length and complexity
- May require additional evaluation to select the best path
