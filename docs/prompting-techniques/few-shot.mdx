description: Guide the model with a few examples to shape its output.
---

Few-shot prompting provides the model with several examples before asking it to perform a similar task.

**Use when:**
- The task benefits from context or demonstration
- You want to guide the model’s style or format

**Pattern:**
Show 2–5 examples, then prompt the model to continue in the same way.

**Examples:**
```text
Q: What is the capital of France?
A: Paris
Q: What is the capital of Germany?
A: Berlin
Q: What is the capital of Italy?
A:
```
```text
Correct the grammar:
Input: "She go to school every day."
Output: She goes to school every day.
Input: "They is playing outside."
Output:
```

**Pitfalls:**
- Too many examples can exceed context limits
- Examples should be relevant and clear
