PAL prompting involves generating code or structured logic to help solve a problem, then using the output to answer the original question.

**Use when:**
- The task involves calculations, logic, or structured data
- You want to improve accuracy with programmatic reasoning

**Pattern:**
1. Ask the model to write code or logic to solve the problem.
2. Use the codeâ€™s output as the answer.

**Examples:**
```text
Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of 7. What is the result?
```
```text
Generate a short script to count the number of words in this paragraph: "Artificial intelligence is transforming many industries."
```

**Pitfalls:**
- Requires code execution environment
- Errors in code generation can affect results
