description: Ask the model to perform a task without providing examples.
---

Zero-shot prompting asks the model to complete a task directly, without showing any examples.

**Use when:**
- The task is simple or well-understood by the model
- You want a quick answer without context

**Pattern:**
Ask the model to perform a task in a single instruction.

**Examples:**
```text
Translate the following sentence to French: "Where is the library?"
```
```text
Summarize this meeting transcript in three bullet points:
[Paste transcript here]
```

**Pitfalls:**
- May produce less accurate results for complex or ambiguous tasks
- Lacks context for nuanced instructions
