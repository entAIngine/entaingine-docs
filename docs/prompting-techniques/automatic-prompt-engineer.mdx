description: Use models to generate and refine prompts automatically.
---

Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE) uses language models to create, test, and refine prompts for specific tasks.

**Use when:**
- You want to optimize prompts for better performance
- Manual prompt design is time-consuming or difficult

**Pattern:**
1. Ask the model to generate several candidate prompts for a task.
2. Test and select the most effective prompt, possibly iterating further.

**Examples:**
```text
Generate three different prompts to extract key points from a news article.
```
```text
Suggest improved prompts for summarizing customer feedback more accurately.
```

**Pitfalls:**
- May require human review to select the best prompt
- Can be resource-intensive if many iterations are needed
