description: Structure information as graphs to enable relational reasoning and complex problem solving.
---

Graph Prompting is a technique that represents information, relationships, and dependencies as graph structures (nodes and edges) to enable language models to perform sophisticated relational reasoning.

:::info What is Graph Prompting? 🕸️
Think of it like creating a visual map of relationships - instead of describing connections in text, you draw them as a graph with dots (nodes) and lines (edges) to help the model understand complex systems better.
:::

By explicitly modeling connections between entities, this approach helps models understand complex systems, navigate multi-step relationships, and solve problems that require understanding of network structures.

This technique is particularly powerful for problems involving social networks, knowledge graphs, workflow dependencies, causal relationships, and any domain where understanding connections between entities is crucial for reasoning.

## 🧩 Core Concepts

Graph prompting leverages several fundamental graph theory concepts:

:::note Key Building Blocks
- **Nodes (Vertices)**: Represent entities, concepts, or states
- **Edges**: Represent relationships, connections, or transitions between nodes  
- **Directed vs Undirected**: Whether relationships have specific direction
- **Weighted Graphs**: When relationships have associated strengths or costs
- **Path Finding**: Discovering routes through the graph structure
- **Subgraphs**: Focusing on specific portions of larger graph structures

## Graph Representation Strategies

### Explicit Graph Notation

```text
Social Network Analysis:

Graph Structure:
Nodes: [Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana, Eve]
Edges: 
- Alice ↔ Bob (friends)
- Bob ↔ Charlie (colleagues)
- Charlie → Diana (mentor relationship)
- Diana ↔ Eve (neighbors)
- Alice → Eve (follows on social media)

Question: What is the shortest path from Alice to Diana, and what types of relationships does it involve?

Analysis:
Path 1: Alice → Bob → Charlie → Diana (3 steps: friend → colleague → mentor)
Path 2: Alice → Eve → Diana (2 steps: social media → neighbor)

Answer: The shortest path is Alice → Eve → Diana (2 steps), involving a social media following relationship and a neighbor relationship.
```

### Adjacency Matrix Representation

```text
Project Dependency Analysis:

Tasks: [A: Research, B: Design, C: Development, D: Testing, E: Deployment]

Dependency Matrix (1 = dependency):
    A  B  C  D  E
A   0  1  0  0  0  (A must complete before B)
B   0  0  1  0  0  (B must complete before C)
C   0  0  0  1  0  (C must complete before D)
D   0  0  0  0  1  (D must complete before E)
E   0  0  0  0  0  (E has no dependencies)

Question: What is the critical path and minimum project duration if each task takes 2 days?

Analysis:
Critical Path: A → B → C → D → E (linear dependency chain)
Duration: 5 tasks × 2 days = 10 days minimum
No parallelization possible due to sequential dependencies.

Answer: The critical path is A→B→C→D→E with a minimum duration of 10 days.
```

### Hierarchical Graph Structures

```text
Organizational Decision Flow:

Graph Structure:
Level 1: [CEO]
Level 2: [VP-Sales, VP-Engineering, VP-Marketing]
Level 3: [Sales-Manager-A, Sales-Manager-B, Eng-Lead-1, Eng-Lead-2, Marketing-Manager]
Level 4: [Sales-Rep-1, Sales-Rep-2, Sales-Rep-3, Developer-A, Developer-B, Designer, Content-Writer]

Decision Flow Rules:
- Budget decisions > $10K require CEO approval
- Technical decisions require VP-Engineering → Eng-Lead → Developer chain
- Sales strategies require VP-Sales → Sales-Manager → Sales-Rep input

Question: What approval path is needed for a $15K software purchase decision that affects the engineering team?

Analysis:
Step 1: Identify decision type: Budget ($15K > $10K) + Technical impact
Step 2: Budget approval path: Developer-A → Eng-Lead-1 → VP-Engineering → CEO
Step 3: Technical input path: Developer-A → Eng-Lead-1 → VP-Engineering
Step 4: Combine paths for comprehensive approval

Answer: Required path is Developer-A → Eng-Lead-1 → VP-Engineering → CEO, ensuring both technical input and budget approval are obtained.
```

## Advanced Graph Prompting Techniques

### Multi-Layer Graph Analysis

```text
Knowledge Graph Reasoning:

Scientific Concept Network:
Layer 1 (Fundamental): [Energy, Matter, Force, Motion]
Layer 2 (Principles): [Conservation, Thermodynamics, Mechanics, Electromagnetism]
Layer 3 (Applications): [Heat-Engines, Electric-Motors, Projectile-Motion, Wave-Propagation]

Cross-layer Relationships:
- Energy → Conservation → Heat-Engines
- Force → Mechanics → Projectile-Motion
- Energy → Electromagnetism → Electric-Motors

Question: Explain how the concept of energy conservation applies to heat engines, showing the conceptual pathway.

Analysis:
Step 1: Start at Energy (fundamental concept)
Step 2: Connect through Conservation (principle layer)
Step 3: Apply to Heat-Engines (application layer)
Step 4: Trace the reasoning pathway

Explanation: Energy (fundamental) → Conservation principle states energy cannot be created or destroyed → Heat-Engines application: thermal energy converts to mechanical work, but total energy remains constant, leading to efficiency limitations described by thermodynamic cycles.
```

### Weighted Graph Optimization

```text
Supply Chain Network Optimization:

Network Nodes: [Supplier-A, Supplier-B, Warehouse-1, Warehouse-2, Distributor-X, Distributor-Y, Customer-Region-1, Customer-Region-2]

Weighted Edges (Cost, Time, Reliability):
- Supplier-A → Warehouse-1: (Cost: $5/unit, Time: 2 days, Reliability: 95%)
- Supplier-A → Warehouse-2: (Cost: $7/unit, Time: 1 day, Reliability: 98%)
- Supplier-B → Warehouse-1: (Cost: $4/unit, Time: 3 days, Reliability: 90%)
- Warehouse-1 → Distributor-X: (Cost: $2/unit, Time: 1 day, Reliability: 97%)

Question: Find the optimal path from suppliers to Customer-Region-1 considering a priority on reliability over cost.

Multi-Criteria Analysis:
Step 1: Weight criteria: Reliability (40%), Cost (35%), Time (25%)
Step 2: Calculate weighted scores for each path
Step 3: Identify optimal path considering all factors

Path 1: Supplier-A → Warehouse-2 → Distributor-X → Customer-Region-1
Score: (98% × 0.4) + (85% cost efficiency × 0.35) + (90% time efficiency × 0.25) = 91.45%

Optimal path prioritizes high-reliability connections while maintaining reasonable cost and time performance.
```

## Problem-Solving Applications

### Causal Reasoning Networks

```text
Root Cause Analysis:

Problem Graph:
Symptoms: [Website-Slow, High-CPU, Database-Timeout, User-Complaints]
Potential Causes: [Memory-Leak, Database-Lock, Network-Congestion, Code-Bug, Hardware-Failure]

Causal Relationships:
- Memory-Leak → High-CPU → Website-Slow
- Database-Lock → Database-Timeout → Website-Slow
- Code-Bug → Memory-Leak OR Database-Lock
- Network-Congestion → Database-Timeout
- Hardware-Failure → High-CPU

Observed Evidence:
- Website-Slow: Yes
- High-CPU: Yes
- Database-Timeout: No
- User-Complaints: Yes

Question: What is the most likely root cause?

Causal Analysis:
Step 1: Work backwards from observed symptoms
Step 2: Website-Slow + High-CPU + No Database-Timeout suggests CPU-related issue
Step 3: High-CPU can be caused by Memory-Leak or Hardware-Failure
Step 4: Memory-Leak is more likely if caused by Code-Bug (more common than hardware failure)

Most Likely Root Cause: Code-Bug → Memory-Leak → High-CPU → Website-Slow
```

### Strategic Planning Networks

```text
Business Strategy Graph:

Strategic Goals: [Market-Expansion, Revenue-Growth, Cost-Reduction, Innovation]
Capabilities: [R&D-Team, Sales-Force, Manufacturing, Digital-Platform]
Market Factors: [Competition, Demand, Technology-Trends, Regulations]

Strategy Relationships:
- R&D-Team → Innovation → Market-Expansion
- Sales-Force → Revenue-Growth → Market-Expansion
- Digital-Platform → Cost-Reduction → Revenue-Growth
- Technology-Trends → Innovation → Competition-Advantage

Resource Constraints:
- R&D-Team bandwidth: 70% utilized
- Sales-Force: Geographic limitations
- Manufacturing: Capacity constraints
- Digital-Platform: Technical debt issues

Question: What strategic path maximizes revenue growth given current constraints?

Strategic Analysis:
Step 1: Identify unconstrained paths to Revenue-Growth
Step 2: Sales-Force → Revenue-Growth (direct, but geographically limited)
Step 3: Digital-Platform → Cost-Reduction → Revenue-Growth (constrained by technical debt)
Step 4: R&D-Team → Innovation → Market-Expansion → Revenue-Growth (R&D has capacity)

Optimal Strategy: Focus R&D capacity on innovation that enables geographic market expansion, leveraging available R&D bandwidth while working around sales and platform constraints.
```

### Network Flow Problems

```text
Information Propagation Analysis:

Communication Network:
Nodes: [HQ, Regional-Office-A, Regional-Office-B, Team-Lead-1, Team-Lead-2, Team-Lead-3, Individual-Contributors]

Flow Capacities (messages per day):
- HQ → Regional-Office-A: 50 messages/day
- Regional-Office-A → Team-Lead-1,2: 20 messages/day each
- Team-Lead → Individual-Contributors: 10 messages/day

Information Priority:
- Critical Updates: Must reach all nodes within 1 day
- Routine Updates: Can take up to 3 days
- Training Materials: Can take up to 7 days

Question: Can the network handle 100 critical updates per day to all employees?

Flow Analysis:
Step 1: Map required flow from HQ to all endpoints
Step 2: Identify bottlenecks in the network
Step 3: Calculate maximum throughput
Step 4: Compare with demand

Bottleneck Analysis:
- HQ can send 50 messages/day to Regional-Office-A
- Regional-Office-A can forward 40 messages/day total to Team Leads
- Bottleneck: Regional-Office-A (40 < 50 capacity)

Answer: No, the network cannot handle 100 critical updates/day. Maximum throughput is limited to 40 messages/day by Regional-Office-A's forwarding capacity. Need to either increase Regional-Office-A capacity or add parallel communication paths.
```

### Common Pitfalls

```text
Incomplete Graph Specification:
Problem: Missing edges or nodes that affect reasoning
Solution: Systematic enumeration of all relevant entities and relationships

Ambiguous Relationships:
Problem: Unclear edge semantics leading to misinterpretation
Solution: Explicit definition of relationship types and properties

Path Finding Errors:
Problem: Missing valid paths or including invalid ones
Solution: Systematic traversal with constraint checking
```

### Model Limitations

**Graph Visualization**: Language models cannot directly visualize graph structures

**Complex Algorithms**: May struggle with sophisticated graph algorithms

**Large-Scale Analysis**: Performance degrades with very large or dense graphs

**Dynamic Updates**: Difficulty tracking changes in graph structure over time

## Integration with Other Techniques

### Graph + Chain-of-Thought

```text
Combine graph structure with step-by-step reasoning:
"Let me work through this graph step by step, starting from node A and examining each possible path..."
```

### Graph + Few-Shot Learning

```text
Provide examples of graph reasoning before presenting the main problem:
Example 1: [Simple graph with clear reasoning]
Example 2: [Similar complexity with solution]
Now solve: [Target graph problem]
```

### Graph + ReAct

```text
Use graph structure to guide action selection:
Thought: "Based on the graph, I need to explore path A-B-C"
Action: Analyze relationship between A and B
Observation: [Results inform next graph traversal step]
```

## Graph Visualization Examples

The following diagrams show different graph representation methods:

### Simple Network Graph
```
Social Network Example:
    Alice ──── Bob
      │         │
      │         │
    Eve ──── Charlie ──── Diana
              │
            Frank
            
Relationships:
• Alice ↔ Bob (friends)
• Alice ↔ Eve (siblings)  
• Bob ↔ Charlie (colleagues)
• Charlie ↔ Diana (neighbors)
• Charlie ↔ Frank (teammates)
• Eve ↔ Charlie (classmates)
```

### Directed Process Flow
```
Task Dependencies:
    [Start] → [Task A] → [Task C] → [End]
                │           ↑
                ▼           │
             [Task B] ──────┘
                │
                ▼
            [Task D]

Rules:
• Task A must complete before Task B and Task C
• Task C requires both Task A and Task B  
• Task D can run parallel to Task C
```

### Weighted Decision Tree
```
Investment Decision Graph:
                [Invest $10K?]
                /            \
           (0.7)              (0.3)
            /                    \
    [High Risk]              [Low Risk]
      /      \                /        \
  (0.4)     (0.6)         (0.8)      (0.2)
   /          \            /            \
[+$50K]    [-$20K]    [+$5K]        [+$1K]

Numbers in () represent probability weights
```

These visual representations help models understand relationships, dependencies, and decision pathways more effectively than pure text descriptions.
