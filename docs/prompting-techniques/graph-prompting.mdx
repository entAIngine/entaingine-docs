description: Structure prompts as graphs to represent relationships and dependencies.
---

Graph prompting organizes information or tasks as nodes and edges, helping the model reason about relationships and dependencies.

**Use when:**
- The task involves complex relationships or dependencies
- You want to visualize or structure information for better reasoning

**Pattern:**
1. Present information as a graph (nodes and edges) or describe relationships explicitly.
2. Ask the model to reason about or traverse the graph to answer questions.

**Examples:**
```text
Given the following relationships:
A is a friend of B. B is a colleague of C. C is a neighbor of D.
Who is connected to D through two steps?
```
```text
Here is a dependency graph for a project:
Task 1 must be completed before Task 2. Task 2 and Task 3 must be completed before Task 4.
List the order in which tasks should be completed.
```

**Pitfalls:**
- May require careful prompt design to represent complex graphs
- The model may struggle with large or highly interconnected graphs
