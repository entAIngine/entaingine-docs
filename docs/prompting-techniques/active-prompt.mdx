Active prompting adapts the prompt in real time based on model feedback or changing context.

**Use when:**
- The task requires iterative refinement or adaptation
- You want to improve results by responding to model output

**Pattern:**
1. Submit an initial prompt and review the output.
2. Adjust the prompt based on feedback or errors, and repeat as needed.

**Examples:**
```text
Initial prompt: "Summarize this article."
If the summary is too long, follow up: "Make it more concise."
```
```text
Ask the model to generate a quiz. If the questions are too difficult, prompt: "Make the questions easier."
```

**Pitfalls:**
- Can be time-consuming if many iterations are needed
- Requires careful tracking of changes and feedback
