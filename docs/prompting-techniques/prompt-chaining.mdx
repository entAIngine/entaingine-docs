Prompt chaining breaks a complex task into smaller steps, using the output of one prompt as the input for the next.

**Use when:**
- The task is too complex for a single prompt
- You want to structure multi-step reasoning or workflows

**Pattern:**
1. Prompt the model for the first step.
2. Use the output as input for the next step, and repeat as needed.

**Examples:**
```text
Step 1: Summarize the following article.
[Paste article]
Step 2: List three key takeaways from the summary above.
```
```text
Step 1: Extract all dates from this text.
Step 2: For each date, explain its significance in the context of the text.
```

**Pitfalls:**
- Errors can compound across steps
- Requires careful management of intermediate outputs
