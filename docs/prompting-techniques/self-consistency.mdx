description: Generate multiple solutions and select the most consistent answer.

Self-consistency prompting generates several responses to the same prompt and selects the answer that appears most frequently or is most consistent.

**Use when:**
- The task is ambiguous or has multiple possible answers
- You want to improve reliability by aggregating outputs

**Pattern:**
Ask the model the same question multiple times, then choose the most common or consistent answer.

**Examples:**
```text
What is the next number in the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ...?
(Repeat the prompt several times and select the most frequent answer.)
```
```text
Classify this review as positive or negative:
"The product exceeded my expectations."
(Ask multiple times and use the majority label.)
```

**Pitfalls:**
- Increases computational cost
- May not resolve ambiguity if the model is inconsistent
