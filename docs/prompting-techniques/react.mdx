description: Integrate reasoning and action for interactive tasks.
---

ReAct prompting alternates between reasoning steps and taking actions, such as querying a tool or environment, to solve a problem interactively.

**Use when:**
- The task requires both reasoning and interaction with external tools or data
- You want the model to explain its process as it acts

**Pattern:**
1. Ask the model to reason about the problem.
2. Take an action (e.g., query a tool), then continue reasoning based on the result.

**Examples:**
```text
Question: What is the population of Japan?
Thought: I need to look up the latest data.
Action: Search for "current population of Japan."
Observation: The population is about 125 million.
Answer: The population of Japan is approximately 125 million.
```
```text
Question: What’s the weather in New York?
Thought: I should check a weather service.
Action: Query weather API for New York.
Observation: It’s 22°C and sunny.
Answer: It’s 22°C and sunny in New York.
```

**Pitfalls:**
- Requires integration with external tools or APIs
- Can be complex to implement in practice
