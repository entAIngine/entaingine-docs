description: Integrate reasoning and action in an iterative loop for complex problem-solving.
---

ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) is a prompting technique that enables language models to interleave reasoning traces with task-specific actions in an iterative manner. Unlike traditional approaches that separate thinking and acting, ReAct creates a dynamic loop where reasoning informs action selection, and action results inform subsequent reasoning steps.

Introduced by [Yao et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629), ReAct has proven particularly effective for tasks requiring both complex reasoning and interaction with external environments, tools, or knowledge sources. This approach enables more robust, interpretable, and flexible problem-solving capabilities.

## Core Architecture

ReAct operates through three fundamental components that work in continuous iteration:

1. **Thought**: Internal reasoning about the current state and next steps
2. **Action**: Specific operations performed in the environment (tool calls, queries, calculations)
3. **Observation**: Results or feedback received from the action, which inform the next reasoning step

This creates a feedback loop: **Thought → Action → Observation → Thought → Action → Observation...**

## Implementation Framework

### Basic ReAct Pattern

```text
Question: What is the current stock price of Tesla and how does it compare to its 52-week high?

Thought: I need to find Tesla's current stock price and its 52-week high to make a comparison.
Action: Search for "Tesla stock price current"
Observation: Tesla (TSLA) is currently trading at $248.50

Thought: Now I need to find Tesla's 52-week high to make the comparison.
Action: Search for "Tesla TSLA 52-week high"
Observation: Tesla's 52-week high is $299.29

Thought: I can now calculate the difference and percentage to provide a comprehensive comparison.
Action: Calculate (299.29 - 248.50) / 299.29 * 100
Observation: Tesla is currently trading about 17% below its 52-week high

Answer: Tesla is currently trading at $248.50, which is $50.79 (about 17%) below its 52-week high of $299.29.
```

### Multi-Tool Integration

```text
Question: Plan a 3-day trip to Paris with a budget of $1,500 for accommodation and activities.

Thought: I need to break this down into accommodation costs, activity costs, and create a day-by-day itinerary within the budget.
Action: Search for "Paris hotel prices 3 nights mid-range"
Observation: Mid-range hotels in Paris cost approximately $150-200 per night

Thought: With $450-600 for accommodation, I have $900-1050 left for activities. Let me find popular attractions and their costs.
Action: Search for "Paris top attractions admission prices 2024"
Observation: Eiffel Tower (€29), Louvre (€17), Notre-Dame area (free), Seine cruise (€15), Montmartre (free)

Thought: I should create a day-by-day plan that balances paid attractions with free activities to stay within budget.
Action: Calculate total for major paid attractions
Observation: Key paid attractions total approximately €61 ($66) per person

Thought: This leaves plenty of budget for meals, transportation, and additional activities. Let me create a structured itinerary.
Action: Plan daily activities with cost breakdown
Observation: Day 1: Louvre + Seine cruise ($32), Day 2: Eiffel Tower + Montmartre ($29), Day 3: Local neighborhoods + shopping (flexible budget)

Answer: Here's a 3-day Paris itinerary within your $1,500 budget:
- Accommodation: $500 (3 nights at mid-range hotel)
- Major attractions: $90 (Louvre, Eiffel Tower, Seine cruise)
- Remaining $910 for meals, local transport, shopping, and additional activities

## Advanced ReAct Patterns

### Error Recovery and Adaptive Reasoning

```text
Question: What's the fastest route from London to Edinburgh by train today?

Thought: I need to check current train schedules and any service disruptions.
Action: Search for "London to Edinburgh train schedule today"
Observation: Error: Unable to access current train schedules

Thought: The direct search failed. Let me try a different approach by checking the main rail operator's website.
Action: Search for "LNER London Edinburgh train times"
Observation: LNER operates direct services, journey time approximately 4 hours 30 minutes

Thought: I have general information but need today's specific schedules. Let me try checking for service alerts.
Action: Search for "UK rail disruptions today London Edinburgh"
Observation: No major disruptions reported on the East Coast Main Line today

Thought: Based on general schedules and lack of disruptions, I can provide typical journey information with a recommendation to check live times.
Action: Compile standard schedule information
Observation: Typical departures every 30 minutes during peak times, fastest journey is 4h 20m

Answer: Based on available information, the fastest trains from London to Edinburgh typically take 4h 20m via LNER direct service. Trains run approximately every 30 minutes during peak times. I recommend checking live schedules on the LNER website for today's specific departure times, as I couldn't access real-time data.
```

### Multi-Step Problem Decomposition

```text
Question: A startup wants to launch in 3 cities simultaneously. They have $2M funding, need to hire 15 people per city, and want to break even in 18 months. Is this feasible?

Thought: This is a complex feasibility analysis. I need to break it down into key cost components: hiring costs, operational expenses, revenue requirements, and timeline constraints.
Action: Research average startup hiring costs and salaries by role
Observation: Average startup employee costs range from $75K-150K annually including benefits and overhead

Thought: With 45 total employees (15 per city), I need to calculate total personnel costs and factor in other operational expenses.
Action: Calculate total annual personnel costs
Observation: Conservative estimate: 45 employees × $100K average = $4.5M annually

Thought: The annual personnel costs alone ($4.5M) exceed the total funding ($2M). This suggests immediate feasibility issues. Let me examine if revenue targets could offset this.
Action: Calculate required monthly revenue to break even in 18 months
Observation: To break even in 18 months with $4.5M annual costs: need ~$5.6M revenue in year 1.5

Thought: The numbers indicate significant challenges. Let me explore alternative scenarios with reduced hiring or phased rollouts.
Action: Model alternative scenarios (phased hiring, reduced headcount)
Observation: Starting with 8 people per city reduces initial costs to ~$2.4M annually, more manageable with $2M funding

Answer: The original plan is not feasible. With 45 employees costing ~$4.5M annually, the $2M funding is insufficient. Alternative recommendations:
1. Start with 8 people per city (24 total) to reduce costs to ~$2.4M annually
2. Consider phased city rollout rather than simultaneous launch
3. Extend break-even timeline to 24-30 months
4. Secure additional funding of $3-4M for the aggressive expansion plan
```

## Domain-Specific Applications

### Research and Information Synthesis

```text
Research Question: What are the environmental impacts of cryptocurrency mining, and what solutions are being developed?

Thought: This requires gathering information from multiple sources about environmental impacts, then researching current solutions and innovations.
Action: Search for "cryptocurrency mining environmental impact 2024 studies"
Observation: Studies show Bitcoin mining consumes ~150 TWh annually, significant carbon footprint

Thought: I need specific data on carbon emissions and energy sources to quantify the impact.
Action: Search for "Bitcoin carbon footprint CO2 emissions per transaction"
Observation: Estimates range from 400-700kg CO2 per Bitcoin transaction, depending on energy mix

Thought: Now I should investigate solutions and alternatives being developed.
Action: Search for "sustainable cryptocurrency solutions proof of stake renewable energy"
Observation: Solutions include: Proof-of-Stake consensus, renewable energy mining, carbon offset programs

Thought: I should gather specific examples of implementation and their effectiveness.
Action: Search for "Ethereum proof of stake energy reduction mining"
Observation: Ethereum's transition to Proof-of-Stake reduced energy consumption by ~99.95%

Answer: Cryptocurrency mining has significant environmental impacts, with Bitcoin alone consuming ~150 TWh annually and producing 400-700kg CO2 per transaction. Key solutions being implemented include:
1. Consensus mechanism changes (Ethereum's PoS transition reduced energy use by 99.95%)
2. Renewable energy adoption by mining operations
3. Carbon offset programs and sustainable mining initiatives
4. Development of more energy-efficient mining hardware

### Troubleshooting and Diagnosis

```text
Problem: Website is loading slowly for users in Europe but works fine for US users.

Thought: This suggests a geographic performance issue. I need to identify potential causes like CDN configuration, server location, or network routing.
Action: Check website loading times from different European locations
Observation: London: 8.5s, Paris: 9.2s, Berlin: 7.8s (US baseline: 2.1s)

Thought: The significant difference confirms geographic issues. Let me check CDN coverage and configuration.
Action: Analyze CDN edge server locations and coverage
Observation: CDN has limited European edge servers, most traffic routing through US east coast

Thought: Poor CDN coverage explains the latency. I should also check for any Europe-specific DNS resolution issues.
Action: Test DNS resolution times from European locations
Observation: DNS resolution adds 1.2-1.8s delay from Europe vs 0.3s from US

Thought: I've identified two main issues: insufficient CDN coverage and DNS latency. Let me formulate comprehensive solutions.
Action: Research optimal CDN configurations for European users
Observation: Recommendations include adding European edge servers, implementing geographic DNS routing

Solution: The slow loading in Europe is caused by:
1. Limited CDN edge servers in Europe (routing traffic to US)
2. DNS resolution delays for European users

Recommendations:
1. Add CDN edge servers in major European cities (London, Frankfurt, Amsterdam)
2. Implement geographic DNS routing
3. Consider European data center deployment for critical assets
4. Monitor performance improvements using European testing locations
```

## Implementation Best Practices

### Structured Reasoning

**Clear thought articulation**: Each reasoning step should be explicit and logical

**Action specification**: Actions should be specific, measurable, and executable

**Observation integration**: Results should be directly incorporated into subsequent reasoning

### Error Handling and Robustness

```text
Thought: I need to search for information about X.
Action: Search for "X information"
Observation: Search failed due to network error

Thought: Direct search failed. Let me try alternative approaches or use cached information I might have.
Action: Try alternative search terms or fallback strategies
Observation: [Result of fallback approach]

This pattern ensures continued progress even when individual actions fail.
```

### Tool Integration Patterns

**Tool selection reasoning**: Explicitly justify why specific tools are chosen

**Result validation**: Cross-check important results using multiple tools when possible

**Graceful degradation**: Have fallback options when preferred tools are unavailable

## Measurement and Optimization

### Performance Metrics

- **Task completion rate**: Percentage of problems successfully solved
- **Action efficiency**: Number of actions needed to reach solutions
- **Reasoning quality**: Logical coherence and justification of steps
- **Tool utilization**: Effectiveness of tool selection and usage

### Common Failure Modes

**Infinite loops**: Repeating the same action without progress

**Tool misuse**: Using inappropriate tools for specific tasks

**Reasoning gaps**: Insufficient justification for action selection

**Context loss**: Failing to maintain awareness of previous observations

## Integration with Other Techniques

### ReAct + Chain-of-Thought

Combining structured reasoning with interactive execution:

```text
Thought: Let me break this complex problem into steps... (CoT reasoning)
Action: Execute first step using appropriate tool
Observation: Results from first step
Thought: Based on these results, the next logical step is... (continued CoT)
```

### ReAct + Self-Consistency

Using multiple ReAct traces to verify solutions:

```text
Generate 3 different ReAct traces for the same problem, then compare final answers for consistency and confidence.
```

## ReAct Process Flow

![ReAct Framework Illustration](/img/prompting-techniques/react.png)

The diagram above illustrates the ReAct framework's core concept of synergizing reasoning and acting. The iterative ReAct process follows this pattern:

```
Problem Input
     ↓
┌─────────────┐
│  THOUGHT    │ ← "I need to search for X"
│  (Reasoning)│
└─────────────┘
     ↓
┌─────────────┐
│   ACTION    │ ← "Search for X"
│  (Execute)  │
└─────────────┘
     ↓
┌─────────────┐
│ OBSERVATION │ ← "Found information Y"
│  (Results)  │
└─────────────┘
     ↓
┌─────────────┐
│  THOUGHT    │ ← "Now I need to analyze Y"
│  (Reasoning)│
└─────────────┘
     ↓
┌─────────────┐
│   ACTION    │ ← "Calculate Z from Y"
│  (Execute)  │
└─────────────┘
     ↓
┌─────────────┐
│ OBSERVATION │ ← "Result is Z"
│  (Results)  │
└─────────────┘
     ↓
   ANSWER
```

This iterative cycle continues until the problem is solved, with each thought informing the next action, and each observation feeding into subsequent reasoning.
