Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting combines text and images to guide the model through step-by-step reasoning.

**Use when:**
- The task involves both visual and textual information
- You want the model to reason about images and text together

**Pattern:**
1. Present an image and a related question.
2. Ask the model to explain its reasoning step by step, referencing both modalities.

**Examples:**
```text
[Image: bar chart of sales by month]
Question: Which month had the highest sales? Explain your answer step by step.
```
```text
[Image: map of Europe]
Question: Which countries border Germany? List them and explain how you identified them from the map.
```

**Pitfalls:**
- Requires models capable of processing images and text
- May be limited by input format or model capabilities
