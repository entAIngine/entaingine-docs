Directional stimulus prompting uses explicit cues or instructions to steer the model’s responses in a desired direction.

**Use when:**
- You want to control the style, tone, or content of the output
- The task benefits from clear guidance

**Pattern:**
Include specific instructions or cues in the prompt to shape the response.

**Examples:**
```text
Write a formal letter of complaint about a delayed shipment.
```
```text
Respond to the following question in a humorous tone: Why did the chicken cross the road?
```

**Pitfalls:**
- Overly restrictive cues can limit creativity
- Ambiguous instructions may be ignored by the model
