![ART Framework Overview](/img/prompting-techniques/ART.png)

ART (Automatic Reasoning and Tool-use) is a prompting technique that enables language models to reason through a problem and use external tools (such as calculators, APIs, or databases) to reach a solution. 

:::info Why ART? üõ†Ô∏è
By interleaving reasoning steps with tool calls, ART allows models to handle tasks that require both logical thinking and access to external information or computation.

By interleaving reasoning steps with tool calls, ART allows models to handle tasks that require both logical thinking and access to external information or computation.

This approach is especially useful for complex, multi-step tasks where the model‚Äôs internal knowledge is insufficient or where precise calculations or up-to-date data are needed.

## üéØ Use When
- The task requires both reasoning and external computation or lookup
- You want the model to use tools to improve accuracy or access real-time data
- The problem involves multi-step workflows or integration with external systems

## Pattern
1. Ask the model to break down the problem and identify when to use a tool.
2. At each step, use the tool‚Äôs output to inform the next reasoning step.
3. Continue until the final answer is reached.

## Examples

### Example 1: Mathematical Calculation with Tool Use
```text
Calculate the square root of 245. (Model decides to use a calculator tool.)
```
*Model output:*
```
Step 1: Recognize that the square root of 245 is not a simple integer.
Step 2: Use calculator tool: sqrt(245) ‚âà 15.652.
Final answer: 15.652
```

### Example 2: Real-Time Data Lookup (new)
```text
Find the current weather in Paris and suggest an outfit for today. (Model queries a weather API, then reasons about clothing.)
```
*Model output:*
```
Step 1: Query weather API for Paris: 22¬∞C, sunny.
Step 2: Based on the weather, suggest wearing light clothing and sunglasses.
Final answer: Wear a t-shirt, shorts, and sunglasses.
```

## ‚úÖ Benefits
- **Accuracy:** Leverages external tools for precise computation or up-to-date information
- **Flexibility:** Can be adapted to a wide range of tasks and tool integrations
- **Transparency:** Makes the reasoning and tool-use process explicit

The performance comparison above demonstrates ART's effectiveness across various reasoning and tool-use benchmarks.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Pitfalls
- Requires integration with external tools or APIs
- May fail if tool use is not well-defined or if the tool is unavailable
- Can increase complexity and latency
