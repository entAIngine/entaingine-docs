ART prompting enables the model to reason through a problem and use external tools (like calculators or APIs) to reach a solution.

**Use when:**
- The task requires both reasoning and external computation or lookup
- You want the model to use tools to improve accuracy

**Pattern:**
1. Ask the model to break down the problem and identify when to use a tool.
2. Use the toolâ€™s output to inform the final answer.

**Examples:**
```text
Calculate the square root of 245. (Model decides to use a calculator tool.)
```
```text
Find the current weather in Paris and suggest an outfit for today. (Model queries a weather API, then reasons about clothing.)
```

**Pitfalls:**
- Requires integration with external tools
- May fail if tool use is not well-defined
