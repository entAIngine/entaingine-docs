description: Use model-generated facts or context to improve responses.
---

Generated knowledge prompting first asks the model to generate relevant facts or context, then uses that information to answer the main question.

**Use when:**
- The task requires background knowledge or context
- You want to improve answer quality by providing supporting information

**Pattern:**
1. Ask the model to list relevant facts or context.
2. Use those facts in a follow-up prompt to answer the main question.

**Examples:**
```text
List three facts about the Amazon rainforest.
Now, using those facts, explain why the Amazon is important for the environment.
```
```text
What are the key features of electric vehicles?
Based on these features, what are the main advantages of electric vehicles over gasoline cars?
```

**Pitfalls:**
- May introduce errors if generated facts are incorrect
- Requires careful prompt design to maintain relevance
