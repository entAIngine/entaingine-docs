description: Incorporate external knowledge into model responses.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines language models with external data sources to provide more accurate and up-to-date answers.

**Use when:**
- The task requires information not in the modelâ€™s training data
- You need factual or current knowledge

**Pattern:**
1. Retrieve relevant documents or facts from an external source.
2. Provide the retrieved information to the model as context for answering the question.

**Examples:**
```text
Given the following article, answer: What are the main causes of climate change?
[Paste article here]
```
```text
Using the provided company knowledge base, summarize the latest product updates.
[Insert knowledge base excerpt]
```

**Pitfalls:**
- Quality depends on the relevance of retrieved data
- May require integration with search or database tools
