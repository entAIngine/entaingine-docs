## Invoice Controlling Example

This example showcases how entAIngine can simplify a real-world finance workflow through automation.

### Scenario: Invoice Processing

In a typical mid-sized company, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) needs to review numerous invoices monthly, each potentially linked to different projects across departments. The key actions in this process are:
1. **Identifying Responsibility**: Determine which department and project are associated with each invoice.
2. **Verification**: Send the invoice to the relevant department head for confirmation.
3. **Approval**: Once confirmed, finalize payment.

### Multi-Step Workflow

Our goal is to automate these actions through entAIngineâ€™s orchestration capabilities, reducing manual effort and enabling a more efficient process. With entAIngine, this process can be streamlined by:
- Assigning department responsibility
- Generating email drafts for verification
- Logging interactions for tracking and accountability

The next steps guide you through setting up this process in entAIngine.
