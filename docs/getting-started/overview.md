# Building Your First Process with entAIngine

Welcome to the **Building Your First Process** guide! Here, we introduce how to harness the power of entAIngine to create enterprise-grade AI applications. This guide will walk you through building a multi-step workflow, from setting up templates and variables to creating an efficient, automated process.

## Overview of Process Building

The true strength of generative AI applications lies in their ability to integrate with existing business workflows, enhancing productivity step by step. Through entAIngine, you can:
- Utilize various AI models, like **GPT-4o**
- Design complex, multi-step orchestration
- Apply reusable templates for consistent processes

### Business Case: Invoice Controlling

To demonstrate entAIngine's capabilities, we’ll walk through an **Invoice Controlling** example. This scenario involves a finance department at a mid-sized company needing to process monthly invoices efficiently. Key tasks include:
1. Identifying the department responsible for each invoice
2. Confirming invoice details with department heads
3. Automating the approval and payment process

By the end of this guide, you’ll have created a reusable and scalable process template. Let’s get started!

### Scenario: Invoice Processing

In a typical mid-sized company, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) needs to review numerous invoices monthly, each potentially linked to different projects across departments. The key actions in this process are:
1. **Identifying Responsibility**: Determine which department and project are associated with each invoice.
2. **Verification**: Send the invoice to the relevant department head for confirmation.
3. **Approval**: Once confirmed, finalize payment.

### Multi-Step Workflow

Our goal is to automate these actions through entAIngine’s orchestration capabilities, reducing manual effort and enabling a more efficient process. With entAIngine, this process can be streamlined by:
- Assigning department responsibility
- Generating email drafts for verification
- Logging interactions for tracking and accountability

The next steps guide you through setting up this process in entAIngine.
