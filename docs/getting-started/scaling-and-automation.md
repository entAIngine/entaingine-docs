# Scaling and Customizing

You can further scale the process by adding more steps and using different models. For instance:

- Use **GPT-4o mini** for simpler tasks to reduce costs.
- Integrate **retrieval-augmented generation** for more accurate responses.
- Incorporate **vector databases** or custom functions for enhanced orchestration.

The flexibility of entAIngine allows you to mix and match models and workflows to create the most efficient process for your specific needs.

## Finalizing and Automating the Workflow

To fully automate the workflow, consider adding further steps beyond just drafting an email. For example:

- **Approval Step**: Once the email is sent, the responsible person can approve or decline the payment. Set up another task to automatically update the CFO on the response.
- **Data Logging**: Store all processed invoices and responses in a central database for tracking and auditing purposes.
- **Notifications**: Implement automatic notifications to alert relevant stakeholders about the status of each invoice. For example, if a response is delayed, a follow-up reminder could be triggered.

These steps help streamline the process from start to finish, ensuring that the entire invoice approval cycle is handled with minimal manual intervention.

## Example Application Types in entAIngine

entAIngine offers various application types that can be used for different purposes:

- **AI Process Application**: A core application used to automate workflows by orchestrating multiple AI services.
- **Company Guru Application**: Works like a company-specific knowledge repository, allowing users to retrieve information quickly without needing a traditional chat interface.
- **Chat Application**: An interactive interface ideal for tasks that require real-time engagement.
- **Editor Application**: Creates documents with embedded AI snippets, perfect for iterative tasks that involve a human-in-the-loop approach.

For our example, we used an **AI Process Application**. Depending on the complexity of your business needs, you might explore other application types offered by entAIngine.

## Summary

By following these steps, you have built your first multi-step process in entAIngine. This guide demonstrated how to automate a finance workflow by breaking it down into smaller tasks and using appropriate models to complete each step. Additionally, we explored ways to scale, customize, and extend the process to achieve a fully automated and efficient workflow.

By adopting this divide-and-conquer approach, you can create reusable, efficient processes that save time, ensure consistent quality, and provide real value across your organization.

## Next Steps

Now that you have successfully created your first process, consider exploring more complex use cases.
