# Application Setup in entAIngine

Let’s start by setting up your first application in entAIngine Studio.

## Creating the Application

1. **Log In**: Visit [entAIngine Studio](https://www.studio.entaingine.com) and log in to your account.
2. **New Application**: Select "AI Process Application" to create a new app. Name it **Invoice Controlling App**.
3. **Configure Settings**: Customize settings, styles, and logos to align with your organization’s needs.

## Defining Variables

In entAIngine, defining variables is crucial for managing data inputs for each process instance.

- **Invoice Document**: Each invoice will vary by instance. Define this as a PDF file input.
- **Department Mapping Document**: Used to link projects to departments. This is also an input in the process.

These variables ensure that each process instance has the necessary information to execute accurately.
