# Developing a Process Mindset

Before building your first application, it's important to adopt the **process mindset**. This mindset is crucial for creating enterprise-grade, process-centric AI solutions that go beyond simple chatbots.

## Key Elements of the Process Mindset

- **Multi-Step Orchestration**: Building enterprise AI applications requires more than simple chat interactions. Complex workflows with multiple steps and models are essential.

- **Reusable Templates**: Templates are blueprints for recurring tasks, providing consistency and efficiency.

## The Importance of Multi-Step Orchestration

Instead of a simple "prompt-answer" cycle, think of each application as a series of orchestrated steps, each designed for a specific goal. Multi-step processes can involve multiple models and even multimodal inputs, leading to more powerful, automated workflows.

For example, consider an application that uses **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** and minimizes human input. This setup allows for sophisticated workflows that improve over time.

## Understanding Process-Driven Thinking

Business activities can be seen as processes — series of actions that lead to a specific outcome. The **divide and conquer** approach is a critical strategy for effective workflows, breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps.

**Example**: Creating a project proposal for an RFP involves gathering material, reviewing references, and drafting sections. Breaking it down into individual tasks ensures high quality and efficiency.

## Reusable Process Templates

To scale processes effectively, develop reusable templates. Each template can include:
- **Case-Specific Input**: Unique data, like an RFP document with specific requirements.
- **Case-Independent Input**: Reusable data, like a database of past projects.

This approach lets you efficiently handle different scenarios without compromising quality.

## Customizing Models for Specific Tasks

Each process step may require different models. For instance:
- Use **GPT-4 mini** for document analysis.
- Use an **OCR model** for scanned documents.

Customizing models for specific tasks ensures efficiency and quality in every workflow step.

## Moving Beyond Chat Interfaces

While chat interfaces are great for creative tasks, they may not be ideal for repeatable, organization-wide tasks. Designing applications with **automated process triggers** and **API integration** enables consistency and scalability, moving beyond the limitations of chat interfaces.

By embracing a process mindset, you can develop AI-powered workflows that save time, ensure quality, and drive impactful results for your organization.
